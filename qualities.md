1. Utility
..* Our main goal was to improve men's experience at the barbershop, and if we provide nothing else but raw information we will have still provided some utility to our users. In every decision we make we want to consider if it is moving towards a solution.
2. User-Efficiency 
..* It should be possible to use this tool right before a haircut, or right after. If you cannot use the product when you need to (like right before your haircut) because the app is too complicated or there are too many steps, people will be less likely to use it. To improve their experience means providing something convenient.
3. Portability
..* The fact that our predicted userbase have many different devices and platforms on which they will access our app is something we need to account for in every design decision.
