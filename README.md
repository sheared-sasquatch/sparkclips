# sparkclips


Guys have a hard time communicating how they want their hair cut.
 * Guys are not familiar with the terminology
   * The terminology is varied, not consistent across all shops, and not always used (so that even if there was an applicable word for your cut, you don’t know it)
 * Trouble remembering what the barber did last time
   * Men tend to get haircuts often. It can be difficult to remember the specifics of a particular haircut (e.g. what clipper size you asked for on the side of a fade, for example).
 * Maybe the barber didn’t explain what they did
   * Perhaps the barber added their own touch of inspiration that was not communicated with the customer beforehand (and you like it), you want someway to identify that and ask for it again.
   * Perhaps the barber has had a different interpretation of the look the customer wanted, and proceeded with the cut according to his/her interpretation (and you didn’t like it), so to avoid this you need a way to be clear about your cut.

Guys don’t know what they want, what looks good (for them), or what hairstyles they should try.
 * There are a lot of hairstyles.
  * The hairstyle may look good at the barber, but difficult to style at home. 
  * Not all hairstyles suit you.
